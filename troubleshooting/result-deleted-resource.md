As of 16 June 2025, you cannot create new instances in this version of this product. All of the functionality is now available in the replacement service {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_full}}. For more information, see [the transition documentation](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-scc-transition). 
{: important}



Results for a resource that you no longer have are still available in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI.
{: shortdesc}


You've deleted a resource from your account, but you are still able to view the results for it from previous evaluations.
{: tsSymptoms}

Results are a point in time statement of your compliance with a specific group of controls. Results are not overwritten. As new evaluations are conducted, new results are provided. In your historical results, the deleted resource continues to display. 
{: tsCauses}

If you don't want to view results for a specific resource, you can remove the scans from your storage.
