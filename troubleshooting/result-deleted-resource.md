# Why do I still see results if I have deleted a resource?
{: #result-deleted-resource}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

Results for a resource that you no longer have are still available in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI.
{: shortdesc}


You've deleted a resource from your account, but you are still able to view the results for it from previous evaluations.
{: tsSymptoms}

Results are a point in time statement of your compliance with a specific group of controls. Results are not overwritten. As new evaluations are conducted, new results are provided. In your historical results, the deleted resource continues to display. 
{: tsCauses}

If you don't want to view results for a specific resource, you can remove the scans from your storage.
