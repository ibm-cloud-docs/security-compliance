In this change log, you can learn about the latest changes, improvements, and updates for the Service Organization Control (AI ICT Guardrails) profile. The change log lists changes that were made, ordered by the version number.

The AI ICT guardrails provides a predefined list of infrastructure and data controls, required to handle AI and Generative AI(GenAI) workloads. These controls include AI specific elaborations across control categories like Risk and Compliance Management, Unified Infrastructure Security and Performance, Application and Workload Protection, Data Protection, Identity and Access Management, Logging, Monitoring. This list of controls is to be used in conjunction with the security baseline of the organization.

## Profile versioning
{: #ai-ict-versioning}

When specifications or controls are edited, removed from, or added to a profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new version is released. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, update your attachments to use the newest profile version.

This profile is consistently updated and is not an exhaustive list of all the controls that might be required for every organization. Be sure to validate the available controls to determine where you might need to supplement your workloads with other security measures.
