# Change log: SOC 2
{: #soc2-change-log}

In this change log, you can learn about the latest changes, improvements, and updates for the Service Organization Control (SOC 2) profile. The change log lists changes that were made, ordered by the version number.

Service Organization Control (SOC) reports are independent, third-party reports issued by assessors certified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) addressing the risk associated with an outsourced service. A SOC 2 report evaluates the internal controls that an organization has put in place to protect customer-owned data and provides details about the nature of those internal controls.


## Profile versioning
{: #soc2-versioning}

When specifications or controls are edited, removed from, or added to a profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new version is released. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, update your attachments to use the newest profile version.

This profile is consistently updated and is not an exhaustive list of all the controls that might be required for every organization. Be sure to validate the available controls to determine where you might need to supplement your workloads with other security measures.
