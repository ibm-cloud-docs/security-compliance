# Information Technology Security Guidance (ITSG)
{: #itsg-change-log}

In this change log, you can learn about the latest changes, improvements, and updates for the Service Organization Control (Information Technology Security Guidance) profile. The change log lists changes that were made, ordered by the version number.

An ITSG compliance profile is a collection of pre-selected security controls from the Information Technology Security Guidance (ITSG) 33 catalog that are tailored to a specific business environment. The ITSG 33 is a document published by the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity (CCCS) that covers IT security risk management.

## Profile versioning
{: #itsg-iec-versioning}

When specifications or controls are edited, removed from, or added to a profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new version is released. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, update your attachments to use the newest profile version.

This profile is consistently updated and is not an exhaustive list of all the controls that might be required for every organization. Be sure to validate the available controls to determine where you might need to supplement your workloads with other security measures.
