# Change log: IBM Cloud Moderate Framework for Financial Services
{: #moderate-fs-change-log}

In this change log, you can learn about the latest changes, improvements, and updates for the Service Organization Control (IBM Cloud Moderate Framework for Financial Services) profile. The change log lists changes that were made, ordered by the version number.

The IBM Cloud Moderate Framework for Financial Services is created from the existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Framework for Financial Services profile. In addition to the controls from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Framework for Financial Services profile, the IBM Cloud Moderate Framework for Financial Services provides a list of controls to add customer managed encryption (Keep Your Own Key (KYOK) and Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)). The list includes controls for Activity Tracker hosted event search. These controls are to be used in conjunction with the security baseline of the organization.

## Profile versioning
{: #moderate-fs-versioning}

When specifications or controls are edited, removed from, or added to a profile in a way that is not compatible with the current version, a new version is released. To take advantage of the changes in a new version, update your attachments to use the newest profile version.

This profile is consistently updated and is not an exhaustive list of all the controls that might be required for every organization. Be sure to validate the available controls to determine where you might need to supplement your workloads with other security measures.
