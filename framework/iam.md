# Managing IAM access for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}
{: #access-management}

Access to the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}} is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM). Every user that accesses the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} in your account must be assigned an access policy, with a defined platform IAM role. The policy determines which actions that a user can perform within the context of the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

Policies enable access to be granted at different levels. Some options include the following actions:

* Access to manage profiles and controls
* Access to view security and compliance posture and results
* Access to manage event notifications



## Roles and permissions

After you define the level of access that a user might need, you can assign them a platform access role. Review the following tables that outline which roles are required to perform actions within the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

The following tables list the platform access roles that are required to manage collectors, credentials, scopes, validations, and profiles in your accounts.
