# Enabling event notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}
{: #event-notifications}

As an administrator of {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}, you might want to send notifications of events in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to other users, or human destinations, by using email, SMS, or other supported delivery channels. Additionally, you might want to send these notifications of events to other applications to build logic by using event-driven programming that uses webhooks, for example. This action is made possible by the integration between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_full}}.

## Enabling notifications
{: #event-notifications-enable}

Events that are generated by the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} can be forwarded to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that is available in the same account. To get started, be sure that you have:

- [**Administrator** platform access](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management) for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
- [**Manager** service access](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-service-access-management) for the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service. To view an existing {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance in your account, you also need **Viewer** platform access or higher.

### Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} in the console
{: #event-notifications-enable-ui}
{: ui}

Before you can enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, be sure that you have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external} that is in the same account. Then, you can use the **Settings > Event Notifications** section in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI to connect the services.

![The image shows the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} screen in the Security and Compliance Center UI.](../images/event-notifications.svg){: caption="Figure 1. Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}" caption-side="bottom"}

1. In the console, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Security and Compliance**.
2. In the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} navigation, click **Settings**.
3. In the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} section, and click **Connect**.
4. In the side panel, review the source details for the connection. Optionally, provide a description.
5. Select the resource group and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that you want to connect.

    If an IAM authorization between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} doesn't exist in your account, a dialog is displayed. Follow the prompts to grant access between the services.

    1. To grant access between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, click **Authorize**.
    2. In the side panel, select **{{site.data.keyword.en_short}}** as the target service.
    3. From the list of instances, select the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that you want to authorize.
    4. Select the **Event Source Manager** role.
    5. Click **Review**.
    6. Click **Assign**.

6. To confirm the connection, click **Connect**.

   A success message is displayed to indicate that {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is now connected to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. If you need to disconnect from {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} later, you can use the options menu ![options icon](../../icons/actions-icon-vertical.svg) **> Disconnect** to remove the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} as a source service in the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance.

   If you choose to disconnect {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, do not delete the IAM authorization between {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. The {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} uses the existing authorization to unregister from {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. If an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance is deleted, any authorizations that exist between the service and {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} are also deleted by IAM.

### Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} with the API
{: #event-notifications-enable-api}
{: api}

Before you can enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, be sure that you have an [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance](/catalog/services/event-notifications){: external} that is in the same account. Then, you can connect to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} programmatically by calling the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} API.

The following example shows a query that you can use to register your {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} source details with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. 
{: curl}

You can find the `event_notifications_instance_crn` value in the console by going to the **Resource list** and clicking the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance row.

## Delivering notifications to select destinations
{: #event-notifications-destinations}

After you enable notifications for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, create topics and subscriptions in {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} so alerts can be forwarded and delivered to your selected destinations.

For a complete list of supported destinations, see the [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} documentation](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destination).
{: tip}

### Email notifications
{: #event-notifications-email}

You can use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} email service](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-email) as a delivery channel for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} event notifications. [Create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} subscription](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-subscription) between an existing topic and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} email service to forward your alerts to various recipients by email.

An email from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} that contains information about a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} event resembles the following example:

```plaintext
Subject: Validation completed: my-test-validation-scan
Body: The following validation scan was successfully completed in the Security and Compliance Center: my-test-validation-scan. You can view the scan results from the Security and Compliance Center in the console. For more information, check out the docs.
```
{: screen}

To receive detailed information about an event notification in your email, select the **Add notification payload** option when you create an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} subscription. Your email displays the [notification payload details](#event-notifications-payload) that are associated with the event.
{: tip}

### Webhooks
{: #event-notifications-webhook}

You can configure a webhook destination so that the properties of an incoming notification can be used programmatically by an app or service. For more information, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} documentation](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destinations-webhook).

## Notification payload details
{: #event-notifications-payload}

Successful events that are generated by a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} component contain various fields that help you to identify the source and details of an event.

Event notifications from {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} contain only metadata properties, such as names or identifiers of resources. Sensitive data, for example API keys or passwords, are not included in generated events.
{: note}

The metadata properties that are sent to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} vary depending on the event type and subtype. For example, if an `com.ibm.cloud.compliance.posture:posture-scan-completed` event takes place, {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} sends a notification payload to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} that is similar to the following example.

```json
{
    "action": "Validation completed",
    "summary": "my-test-scan",
    "scope": "my-test-scope",
    "profile": "CIS IBM Foundations Benchmark 1.0.0",
    "start_time": "2021-11-24 13:46:21.672",
    "end_time": "2021-11-24 13:46:21.672"
}
```
{: screen}
