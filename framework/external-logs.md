## Platform logs 
{: #logging_ov}

Platform logs are logs that are exposed by logging-enabled services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

- Platform logs are regional.

	You can monitor logs from enabled services on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} in the region where the service is available.

- You can configure one instance only of the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service per region to collect platform logs in that location.

	You can have multiple {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instances in a location. However, only one instance in a location (region) can be configured to receive logs from [enabled services](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-cloud_services) in that {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} location.

- To configure a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance, you must set on the `platform logs` configuration setting. Also, you must have the platform role `editor` or higher for the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} service in your account.

	To enable platform logs, see:

	- [Configuring platform logs through the Observability dashboard](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs#config_svc_logs_ui)

	- [Configuring platform logs from the command line](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs#platform_logs_enabling_cli)

For more information about platform logs, see [Configuring IBM Cloud platform logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs).

## Viewing logs
{: #logging_view}

If a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance in a region is already enabled to collect platform logs, logs from the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service in that region are collected automatically and available for analysis through this instance.

To view and analyze platform logs for a {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} instance, check that the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance is provisioned in the same region where the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} instance that you want to monitor is available.
