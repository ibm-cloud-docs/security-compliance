# Storing and encrypting data in {[scc]}
{: #mng-data}

To ensure that you can securely manage your data when you use {[scc-full]}, it is important to know exactly what data is stored and encrypted, and how you can delete any stored personal data.
{: shortdesc}

For more information about how {[cloud]} platform secures your data, see [How do I know that my data is safe?](/docs/overview?topic=overview-security)
{: tip}

## How is my configuration data obtained?
{: #data-obtained}
	
To evaluate your account for compliance, {[scc]} gathers resource configuration information from your targeted environment through an internal service-to-service authorization. The policy allows for {[scc]} to read the configuration but the service is unable to change it in any way. Collected data includes the properties and configurations for supported services, network objects, hosts, databases, Kubernetes platforms, and virtual machines.


## How is data stored?
{: #data-storage}

The results data that is generated by the service is stored in a {[cos]} bucket that is owned by the customer. For help configuring storage, see [Storing data in {[scc]}]({[link]}-storage).


## Deleting your data
{: #data-delete}

When you work with {[scc]}, you own the data that is generated. It is automatically forwarded to a {[cos]} bucket that you connect. Managing the removal of data is your responsibility.
