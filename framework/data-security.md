{: tip}

## How is my configuration data obtained?
{: #data-obtained}

To evaluate your account for compliance, {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} gathers resource configuration information from your targeted environment through an internal service-to-service authorization. The policy allows for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to read the configuration but the service is unable to change it in any way. Collected data includes the properties and configurations for supported services, network objects, hosts, databases, Kubernetes platforms, and virtual machines.


## How is data stored?
{: #data-storage}

The results data that is generated by the service is stored in a Cloud Object Storage bucket that is owned by the customer. For help configuring storage, see [Storing data in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-storage).


## Deleting your data
{: #data-delete}

When you work with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you own the data that is generated. It is automatically forwarded to a Cloud Object Storage bucket that you connect. Managing the removal of data is your responsibility.
