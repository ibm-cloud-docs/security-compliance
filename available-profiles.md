# Available predefined profiles 
{: #predefined-profiles}

With the {[scc-full]}, you can take advantage of predefined profiles that contain collections of controls that are curated based on industry standards. You can also create your own [Assessment-based profiles]({[link]}-build-custom-profiles).  
{: shortdesc}

{[scc]} supports predefined profiles. Within each profile, you can review the controls that are required to be compliant. You can't modify or remove controls from a predefined profile. But, you can use a predefined profile as a base to create a new profile to choose only the controls and goals that are relevant for your business. 

Then, if needed, you can update the default parameters that are associated with the goals within each predefined profile. 

## Updating predefined profiles
{: #profile-versions}

At times, {[scc]} publishes new versions of {[cloud]} predefined profiles. Reasons for reversioning include:

* to remove rules that are invalid or are no longer required to meet controls;
* to add new rules and extend the compliance coverage of profiles;
* to fix defective rules.
