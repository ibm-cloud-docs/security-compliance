## How do I start monitoring a rule?
{: #faq-monitor-rule}
{: faq}
{: support}

{{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} supports two types of rules - predefined and custom. Predefined rules are associated with specifications by default and are automatically monitored when you create an attachment to a profile. Custom rules can be monitored after they are associated with a specification by customizing a control library. Then, you select those controls when you create an attachment.


## Can I create a rule for a service that I didn't provision?
{: #faq-provisioned-rule}
{: faq}
{: support}

Yes, you can create rules for services or resources that are not already provisioned in your accounts. When the service or resource is created, it is automatically evaluated according to your rule definition.



## Why don't I see additional details for everything?
{: #faq-evidence}
{: faq}
{: support}

When you look at your results in the UI, you see that some results have "Additional details". This is because the results are associated with the Toolchain service. The Toolchain pipeline sends the associated details and evidence along with the results to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
