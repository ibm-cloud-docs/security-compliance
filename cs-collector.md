# Managing collectors
{: #collector}

In {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}, a collector is used to gather the configuration information of your resources and then validate it against your specified requirements. 
{: shortdesc}


The collector-based architecture is deprecated. For more information, see the [release notes](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-release-notes).
{: deprecated}


## Before you begin
{: #before-collector}

Before you get started, be sure that you have the level of access that is necessary to view and manage collectors. To administer collectors, you need the [**Editor** platform role or higher](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management).

Additionally, you must configure your access control list (ACL) to ensure that communication can take place without configuring an `allow_all` policy. Add the following hostnames to an allowlist.

```
accounts.cloud.ibm.com, api.cis.cloud.ibm.com, api.softlayer.com, api.*.softlayer.com, api.*.logging.cloud.ibm.com, api.shell.cloud.ibm.com, api.*.databases.cloud.ibm.com, config.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com, config.private.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com, config.public.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com, containers.cloud.ibm.com, directlink.cloud.ibm.com, iam.cloud.ibm.com, iam.bluemix.net, otc-api.*.devops.cloud.ibm.com, private.*.certificate-manager.cloud.ibm.com, private.*.kms.cloud.ibm.com, resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com, schematics.cloud.ibm.com, s3.*.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud, s3.private.*.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud, s3.direct.*.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud, transit.cloud.ibm.com, user-management.cloud.ibm.com, *.appid.cloud.ibm.com, *.certificate-manager.cloud.ibm.com, *.iaas.cloud.ibm.com, *.icr.io, *.kms.cloud.ibm.com, *.mybluemix.net, *.secadvisor.cloud.ibm.com, *.*.secrets-manager.appdomain.cloud

## Understanding collectors
{: #understand-collector}

A collector is a software module that is packaged as a container image. It is deployed on infrastructure that has access to the resources in your account. You can choose to have IBM manage your collector, or you can choose to deploy it and manage it yourself.

IBM-managed collectors
:   When you choose to have IBM manage your collector, it is installed on IBM infrastructure as a Universal Base Image (UBI). IBM is responsible for the installation and management for the lifecycle of the collector. This option gives you the ability to focus on just the health and security of your resources. Before you get started, be sure that you understand [the limitations](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-service-limits).

Customer-managed collectors
:  In some situations, an IBM-managed collector might not be possible. If your organization has policies about the ownership of infrastructure or specific security constraints, you can always continue to manage your own collector. With a customer-owned collector, you own the infrastructure and you have total control over where the collector is installed. You can install the collector as a UBI or Ubuntu container image. The Ubuntu image is not compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).

If you choose to work with a customer-managed collector, you are responsible for the stability of the virtual machine on which you deploy the collector. Your responsibilities include processing power, disk space, log clean up, access control, and port management. You are also responsible for ensuring that your copy of the Watchtower image remains stable and up to date. When you install a collector, you install both the collector image and the Watchtower image. The Watchtower image continuously monitors the container registry where the collector image is stored to detect updates to the image. If an update is detected, the Watchtower image forces an update to the collector. For more information about Watchtower, see the [open source docs](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower){: external}.

### Understanding collector statuses
{: #collector-status}

When you are looking at the UI, you might see the following collector statuses. You can monitor the status changes of your collectors. Additionally, you can filter your list of collectors in the UI by selecting the statuses that you want to observe.

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Activating collector | Your collector is being activated. | 
| Active | Your collector is now active. |
| Approval required | You must approve the activation of your collector. |
| Deleted | Your collector was deleted. |
| Download in progress | Your collector is downloading. |
| Expired | Your collector expired. |
| Inactive | Your collector is not active. |
| Install in progress | Your collector is being installed. |
| Installation failed | Your collector failed to install. |
| Ready to install | Your collector is ready to be installed. |
| Waiting for upgrade | Your collector is waiting to be upgraded. | 
{: caption="Table 1. Description of collector statuses" caption-side="top"}


### Working with multiple collectors
{: #collector-multiple}

If you're working with more than one cloud provider or an on-premises environment, you might need to install more than one collector. A collector is only able to access the subnets that it has appropriate access for. For example, the collector might need to have `icmp ping` access to run an Nmap scan, `SSH` access for accessing VMs or `winrm` access to access a windows machine. One collector is able to access multiple subnets, but you must be sure that it is correctly sized to scan a specified environment.

If your collector needs to access multiple subnets, you must add them to the subnet list for the collector. The file name that you need to update is `<collector_dir_path>/config/discovery_subnet_list.cfg`.

### Installing a collector on a virtual machine
{: #install-collector-vm}

You can install a collector on any VM that has access to your resource configurations.

1. Verify the installation requirements.

	| Machine type | Minimum requirement | 
	|:-------------|:--------------------|
	| Virtual | **Image:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Ubuntu 18.x  \n **Profile:** `cx2-2x4` (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and 4GBPS)  \n **Boot volume:** 50 GB disk space |
	| Physical | **Image:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Ubuntu 18.x  \n **Processor:** Intel Server Class QuadCore processor  \n **Profile:** 8 GB RAM  \n **Boot volume:** 50 GB Disk Space |
	{: caption="Table 5. Minimum machine requirements to install a collector" caption-side="top"}

2. Log in to your virtual machine by using SSH in your terminal.

   ```sh
   ssh root@<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Be sure that you have the required software on your VSI and that it is up to date. If you're working with Ubuntu, you can use the following commands.

   1. Verify that your OS image is up to date. In Ubuntu, you can run the following command: 

      ```sh
      sudo apt-get update
      ```
      {: codeblock}
  
   2. If you don't have it already, install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/){: external} by using the command for your OS.

      ```sh
      sudo apt-get install docker-compose
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      Depending on the version of Docker that you use, you might be charged for the use of Docker Compose. Be sure that you understand the [subscription model](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/){: external}.
      {: note}

   3. If you plan to use your collector to run on-premises resource scans, install [Nmap version 7.6 or higher](https://nmap.org/download.html){: external} by using the command for your OS. If you're working with Ubuntu, you can use the following command.

      ```sh
      sudo apt-get install nmap
      ```
      {: codeblock}

4. Transfer the collector installation file to your VSI. If you are using VIM in your command line, you can use the following steps as an example.

   1. Locally, open the **initiate_collector.sh** file that you downloaded and copy its contents.
   2. From your command line, open the VIM editor.

      ```sh
      vi initiate_collector.sh
      ```
      {: codeblock}

   3. Press **i** to insert content.
   4. Paste the content that you previously copied.
   5. Press the **Escape** key to exist edit mode.
   6. Type `:wq` and push enter to save and exit VIM.
   7. To confirm that the file was created, run the `ls` command.

5. Change the permissions of the `initiate_collector.sh` file to allow it to run.

   ```sh
   chmod +x initiate_collector.sh
   ```
   {: codeblock}

6. Install the collector by running the following command and then answering the following prompts as they are asked. 

   ```sh
   ./initiate_collector.sh
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   | Prompt | Response |
   |:-------|:---------|
   | Data Path | Provide the data path to your host machine. For example, `/root/compliance/`. |
   | Nmap validation | You need to run an Nmap validation only if your resources exist behind a firewall. |
	| Proxy | As extra protection, your organization might want to configure a proxy to use as an intermediary between the collector and your resources. If you select yes, be sure to provide the IP address that you want to use as the proxy, the port of your servicer, and the credentials that are needed. Then, be sure to add the following IP addresses and ports to your ACL. DNS: `161.26.0.6` and `53`. Service endpoints: `166.8.0.0` and `443`.
   | Registration key | Provide the registration key. This registration key can be found in the table on the **Collectors** page of the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI. Expand the details for the collector that you want to register and copy the key. |
   {: caption="Table 6. Collector installation prompts" caption-side="top"}

   The registration key is active for 24 hours. Installation must be complete and the collector must be activated within that timeframe.
   {: important}

7. Confirm that everything is installed.

   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Your output looks similar to the following example.

   ```xml
