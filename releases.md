Subscopes
:   You can now segment a scope to ensure that only those users who need to have access to certain resource information have it. For more information see, [Segmenting your scope](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-subscopes).


## 17 September 2024
{: #security-compliance-sep1724}
{: release-note}

Rules changes are available
:   The following rules are updated. Most of these rules are mapped to following profiles.

   - IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services(1.5.0),
   - IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services(1.6.0),
   - IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services (Moderate)(1.0.0).
   - IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services(1.7.0)
   - IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services (Moderate)(1.1.0)
   - ISO/IEC 27001:2022

   A new input parameter was added to the following set of rules to check if all CBR-allowed IP CIDRs that are configured allow access to too many IP addresses to prvent allowing access to unforeseen IP addresses. You can then block any inadvertent changes to the netmask bit portion of CIDR.

   With this input parameter (`netmask_bits_length`), you can specify the netmask bit length that applies to your network setup. If any CBR rules have the allowed IP CIDR netmask bit length set to less than or equal to `netmask_bits_length`, then the rule is considered noncompliant.

   For example, if the parameter `netmask_bits_length` is set to `8`, then all netmask bit lengths that are in the IP CIDRs that are allowed by CBR rule must be greater than 8 (9 thru 32).

   This rule, in all pre-defined profiles, has 256 as the default value to allow all configured netmask bit lengths. You can set this parameter to the value that you need.

AI Security Guardrails 2.0 profile
:   Version 1.0.0 of the AI Security Guardrails 2.0 profile is now available in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}. For more information about the profile, see [the change log](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-ai-security-change-log).

Scanning Watson Machine Learning resources is now available with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}
:   You can now scan your Watson Machine Learning resources against the AI Security Guardrails 2.0 profile. You can enable access for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to scan your Watson Machine Learning resources by assigning customer credentials (API keys) that are stored in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}. For more information, see Scanning Watson Machine Learning resources. 


Using trusted profiles to scan your main account 
:   As of 9 July 2024, when you are enabling scanning of resources across accounts, if you add your main account as a target, you have to use trusted profiles to run the scans. If you change the trusted profile, the scan results are impacted. 

   To change the trusted profile and avoid issues with your scan results, you must delete the target and all the attachments that are on the account first. Then, you can create a new target with the updated trusted profile. No action is required at this time.

Updates to IAM roles for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}
:   Last year, {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} started the migration from a global service to a regional service. Starting 7 June 2024, the next phase of the migration, which is focused on updating IAM roles, will begin. Currently, actions for the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service are mapped to platform-based roles. Now that the service has moved to a regional model, the actions for the product will be mapped to the service roles. As an administrator of an account, it is your responsibility to assign access and ensure that each user is assigned the minimum role to perform the actions required for their position. If your account actively uses {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} you must review the permissions assigned to those that work with the service to ensure that they have the appropriate service level role.To evaluate which roles are currently assigned in your account, you can use the IAM UI. To get to the IAM UI, go to the IBM Cloud console, and click **Manage (IAM)** and select the user, trusted profile, or access group that you want to validate. For more information about the new mappings and role requirements, see [Managing IAM access for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-access-management).

   As you determine the impact of this change to your organization, please keep the following dates in mind.

   * **7 June 2024**: Starting on this date, the action to role mapping for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be updated to include the service level roles and the change will be visible in the IAM UI. The platform roles will continue to function. During this time period, you must evaluate and reassign permissions as needed for the members of your organization.

   * **28 May 2025**: On this date, the action to role mapping will be updated to remove the platform roles that are associated with specific {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} actions. Actions that are no longer used by the service will also be removed on this date. If you have not completed the evaluation and assigned access to the service roles prior to this date, users might lose the access that is required to perform their tasks in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

   Additionally, the following unused or stale actions will be removed from the IAM definition as part of the migration.

   * `compliance.configuration-governance.results-create`
   * `compliance.configuration-governance.results-delete`

Reminder: {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will become regional
:   Starting 8 July 2023 {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be a provisionable, regional service offering in the IBM Cloud catalog. With this change, you will have full control over the region that is used when {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} processes your data. To process data in different regions, you can create multiple instances of the service in a single account.

   [deprecated]{: tag-deprecated} To support this change, support for the collector-based architecture was deprecated. This means that all of the configurations surrounding collectors, goal-based profiles, collector-based scans, goal-based results, and credentials will be removed at the end of support on 1 July 2023.

   Additionally, the following changes will be made:
   * Any Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies or context-based restrictions that are scoped to “All Account Management Services” will no longer apply to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}. Users who have access to “All Identity and Access Enabled Services” will now have access to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
   * If users have access only to products added to a private catalog and not the full IBM Cloud catalog, then {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} must be added to their private catalog to enable them to create an instance.
   * If users have a quota on the number of resources for their account that has already been met, instances of the service will not be able to be created.

   During this update, you are responsible for the migration of your scan configurations to the new architecture. You can start this migration at any time.

   As you begin your migration, please keep the following dates in mind:
   * 8 June 2023: The location setting in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be frozen until the upgrade is complete. The location that is specified in the service is the region in which your new instance will be created. Additional instances can be created starting in July.
   * 1 July 2023: The collector-based architecture will be removed from {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
   * 8 July 2023: A regional instance of {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be available in your account based on your set location and the global instance will be removed. Additionally, the changes to IAM and context-based restrictions take effect.

   You might see two instances of {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} through the Billing page during the migration period although you can’t see two instances in your account. This is due to the way that the migration is being conducted. You are only billed through one. When the migration is complete, the global instance will be removed from your account.

Customize notifications per attachment
:   As part of creating an attachment, you can now configure notifications by attachment. You can set a customized failure threshold or select specific controls that you want to be alerted for. By default, when notifications are enabled for your account, you are notified if 15% of the controls in a single scan fail. To adjust this you can adjust the threshold or you can turn off notifications as you create an attachment.

If you already have notifications configured they were migrated to the new format. To update your notification settings, you can do so in the settings of each attachment.

A new and improved experience for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is now available!
:   We've been working in the background for the past several months to incorporate all of the feedback that we've received and we’re excited to share our new and improved architecture with you. When you work with our new architecture, there are a few changes to terminology and functionality that you’ll need to be aware of.

   * **Enterprise support**: Hierarchical management of organizational compliance

   * **Simplified setup**: There is no need to create service IDs, write IAM policies, or manage API keys when working with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

   * **More customization**: Create version-able controls, profiles, and assessments through simple declarative rules and then customize evaluation parameters for each attachment.

   * **New profile format**: Moving from a goal-based architecture to an assessment based architecture to provide more transparency into how evaluations are conducted.

   * **Customer-owned storage**: Duration and capacity limits for saved monitoring results are removed by allowing you to secure your compliance data in your own Cloud Object Storage bucket

   * **Terminology**: With the introduction of our new architecture, terminology has been re-evaluated and updated to ensure a more cohesive experience of the product.

   As previously announced, the Configuration Governance component has been removed as part of this release. This means that any rules that previously existed in your account have been removed and are no longer being enforced.
