Reminder: {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will become regional

:   Starting 8 July 2023 {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be a provisionable, regional service offering in the IBM Cloud catalog. With this change, you will have full control over the region that is used when {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} processes your data. To process data in different regions, you can create multiple instances of the service in a single account.

   [deprecated]{: tag-deprecated} To support this change, support for the collector-based architecture was deprecated. This means that all of the configurations surrounding collectors, goal-based profiles, collector-based scans, goal-based results, and credentials will be removed at the end of support on 1 July 2023.

   Additionally, the following changes will be made:
   * Any Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies or context-based restrictions that are scoped to “All Account Management Services” will no longer apply to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}. Users who have access to “All Identity and Access Enabled Services” will now have access to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
   * If users have access only to products added to a private catalog and not the full IBM Cloud catalog, then {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} must be added to their private catalog to enable them to create an instance.
   * If users have a quota on the number of resources for their account that has already been met, instances of the service will not be able to be created.

   During this update, you are responsible for the migration of your scan configurations to the new architecture. You can start this migration at any time.

   As you begin your migration, please keep the following dates in mind:
   * 8 June 2023: The location setting in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be frozen until the upgrade is complete. The location that is specified in the service is the region in which your new instance will be created. Additional instances can be created starting in July.
   * 1 July 2023: The collector-based architecture will be removed from {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
   * 8 July 2023: A regional instance of {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} will be available in your account based on your set location and the global instance will be removed. Additionally, the changes to IAM and context-based restrictions take effect.

   You might see two instances of {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} through the Billing page during the migration period although you can’t see two instances in your account. This is due to the way that the migration is being conducted. You are only billed through one. When the migration is complete, the global instance will be removed from your account.

{: release-note}

Customize notifications per attachment
:   As part of creating an attachment, you can now configure notifications by attachment. You can set a customized failure threshold or select specific controls that you want to be alerted for. By default, when notifications are enabled for your account, you are notified if 15% of the controls in a single scan fail. To adjust this you can adjust the threshold or you can turn off notifications as you create an attachment.

If you already have notifications configured they were migrated to the new format. To update your notification settings, you can do so in the settings of each attachment.

A new and improved experience for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is now available!
:   We've been working in the background for the past several months to incorporate all of the feedback that we've received and we’re excited to share our new and improved architecture with you. When you work with our new architecture, there are a few changes to terminology and functionality that you’ll need to be aware of.

   * **Enterprise support**: Hierarchical management of organizational compliance

   * **Simplified setup**: There is no need to create service IDs, write IAM policies, or manage API keys when working with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

   * **More customization**: Create version-able controls, profiles, and assessments through simple declarative rules and then customize evaluation parameters for each attachment.

   * **New profile format**: Moving from a goal-based architecture to an assessment based architecture to provide more transparency into how evaluations are conducted.

   * **Customer-owned storage**: Duration and capacity limits for saved monitoring results are removed by allowing you to secure your compliance data in your own Cloud Object Storage bucket

   * **Terminology**: With the introduction of our new architecture, terminology has been re-evaluated and updated to ensure a more cohesive experience of the product.

   As previously announced, the Configuration Governance component has been removed as part of this release. This means that any rules that previously existed in your account have been removed and are no longer being enforced.

Updates coming soon!
:   A new and improved experience for {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} is on its way! We've been working in the background for the past several months to incorporate all the feedback that we've received and we're almost ready to share it with you. To ensure the best experience possible, there are a few changes to the current functionality that you'll need to be aware of. When our new experience is released, you can expect to see:

   **A more seamless integration for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources!** Not only will you no longer be required to configure and deploy a collector to scan resources that run on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, but your experience in the UI will now be more consistent throughout the product.

   **The removal of Configuration Governance**. Although rules will continue to exist in the new experience, we are temporarily removing the Configuration Governance component of the service which is currently used for enforcement. While there is no timeline in place for this functionality to return, we will keep you updated.
